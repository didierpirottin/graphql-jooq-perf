= Demo Spring for GraphQL - JooQ - Performance Optimisations

This project is a demo on how to implement a link:https://graphql.org/[GraphQL] service in Java using link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql[Spring for GraphQL] and link:https://www.jooq.org/[JooQ] for database access.

The main objective is to highlight some important attention points in the implementation, more specifically related to *potential performance issues*, and to address them.
